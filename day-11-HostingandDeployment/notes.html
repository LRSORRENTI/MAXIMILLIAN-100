      <h1>Serving a website - Hosting & Deployment</h1>
      <p>
        In this section, we'll go over what hosting and deployment actually
        means, and how we go about actually putting our website on the website
      </p>
      <h2>What is hosting & deployment?</h2>
      <p>First let's clarify what these terms actually mean</p>
      <p>
        <b> DEPLOYING A WEBSITE </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we deploy a website we move the website code onto a remote machine
        ("server") that serves the website to visitors
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Hosting </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        When we host a website, the remote machine ("server") hosts or stores
        the website code and serves it to the visitors
      </p>
      <p>
        The main takeaway is that if we want to actually make our website
        visible to others, it needs to be both hosted and deployed
      </p>
      <p>
        So when we go to amazon.com a request is sent to amazon's servers, and
        since amazon took their website code and moved it onto a server, our
        browswer is able to send a request there, and the server bought by
        amazon, which hosts that website is then able to send that website back
        to you, the html, css instructions
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Deploying on NETLIFY</h2>
      <p>
        All we need to do is drag our folder that contains our html, css, and js
        and drop it into the upload section, and that's it, netlify will give a
        confirmation that your site is now live at
        http://example-site.netlify.app, or whatever domain name netlify will
        auto-generate for you
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to chamge our domain name, we do need to sign up and actually
        buy a domain, which will then offer HTTPS, versioning, rollbacks and
        more
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>FAVICONS</h2>
      <p>
        Most websites will configure a favicon, which is a small icon in the
        browswer tab section, for github it's the small cat logo, for stack
        overflow it's the orange half-moon shape stack icon, and for udemy it's
        the purple u icon
      </p>
      <p>
        If we don't set one, nothing breaks or anything, but we can add one
        easily
      </p>
      <p>
        Google favicon generator, then go to one of the websites and we can
        upload an image, and then the generator will return a generated favicon
        based on the image uploaded
      </p>
      <p>
        favicon.io is a good choice, after we generate and download our favicon,
        we add it into our project folder at the root or in the images folder
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to add the favicon we go into our html, and under the link to our
        stylesheet, we add another link, but we change the "rel" to "rel="icon""
        and href="myfavicon.ico" then we set type="image/x-icon"
      </p>
      <p>
        It's easier to copy / paste what favicon.io will display after
        generation, because favicon.io will also include 'link rel' that will
        configure your icon on all types of devices and platforms, so it's
        auto-optimized for whatever kind of device the user is viewing it on
      </p>
