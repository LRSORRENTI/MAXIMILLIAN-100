      <h1>Notes for Maximilian Schwarzmüller 100 days of code</h1>
      <p>
        These will be notes I'll take during the course, I am definitely jumping
        between too many courses at once, but I need to keep learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the beginning of the course is review for me, so I may be
        skipping the early sections, but I'm going to skim through everything to
        see if there are topics related to certain fundamentals I need more
        practice with

      <h2>CSS PSEUDO SELECTORS</h2>
      <p>
        Max is going over pseudo selectors in CSS, this is one thing I need more
        experience with
      </p>
      <p>
        When we utilize CSS pseudo selectors, we want certain things to happen
        only when the pseudo selector is active
      </p>
      <p id="p1">
        So if I set this paragraph to have the pseudo selector:
        #p1:hover{background-color:plum;} everything inside this paragraph, and
        only this paragraph will change the background to plum
