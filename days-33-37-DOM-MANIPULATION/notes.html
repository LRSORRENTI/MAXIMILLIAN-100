      <h2>The Global "window" & "document" Objects [Day 33]</h2>
      <p>So let's get started, 
        when we work with the DOM we'll always use these 
        two global variables
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                window
            </li>
            <li>
                document
            </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        These variables store objects inside them, and 
        they in turn contain built in functions
      </p>
      <p>
        The global window object itself holds information 
        and functionality related to the active browser window 
        & tab
      </p>
      <p>
        If we console.log(window) in our js file, the 
        console will display all the properties and 
        methods inside of the window object, don't 
        be intimidated, most developers won't need to know 
        all the properties and methods of the window object 
        by heart 
      </p>
      <p>
        The main object we'll use frequently is the 'document'
        object, or the document property on the window object
      </p>
      <p>
        This document object is a 'nested object' because 
        it's an object inside of another object
      </p>
      <p>
        And this document onject contains info and functionality 
        of the loaded website content
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what allows us to gain access to 
        html elements with methods like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            getElementById()
        </li>
        <li>
            getElementByClassName()
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>
            What is the "DOM"?
        </h2>
        <p>
            DOM stands for DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL, 
            which basically is just what the website looks 
            like in it's totality, what the browswer parses 
            and renders, what we see
        </p>
        <p>
            So every single html element we create, this 
            paragraph tag I'm writing notes inside of right 
            at this very moment, is translated to a 
            javascript object 
        </p>
        <p>
            And since we have javascript representation 
            of our html code, we can select things from 
            our html in javascript and modify them
        </p>
        <p>
            And the 'door' that gives us access to the 
            html elements is the 'document' window object
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the document object we access the DOM
        </p>
        <p>
            This is important, since any time we want to 
            dynamically render things in real time on our 
            web site or app, we need to understand how to 
            manipulate the DOM
        </p>
